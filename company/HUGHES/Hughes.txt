Test Conducted by Hughes Banglore:-
  
System config. Interrupt stored in  Ans-ROM 
RS-232 A-serial port 
sliding window protocol A-transport layer 
IPV6  A-16 bytes 
set of protocol good for client host ---perhaps tcp, ip,arp 
semaphore   A- signal 
interpolation search A- good for all problem space 
data redundant, faster retrieval of data A-RAID 
intel386 uses A-demand paging as well as  segmentation with level 2 
ms dos os/2 uses A-linked allocation 
shallow binding, deep binding A-parameter passing(check) 
to access the database in restricted mode options-create user, session,restrict session.. 
disk scheduling A-O.S 
(110+0)* (011+1)* A all strings of 0 &1 including empty string 
external memory fragmentation A-paging 
write through cache A- maintained in primary memory 
allow only 1 regular exp ---A dfa without E 
best sorting—A binary tree sorting 
half adder to full adder A-2 
B-tree  a-5 
given tree was b+ tree 
exception code must defined  A-exception section only(check) 
Dma cycle steal, Dma memory steal 
to generate sequence a-identified by(not sure) 
tcp is slower than udp  A-because it has to process sequencing 
UMTP-no idea 
thread swiching     stack will be switched, memory space will be switched(check) 
strcpy(….)  A-hello 
session layer-RPC 
define  mul, …num 3    ans 8 
cpu acknowledges the intrrrupt and branches to subroutine is the ans 
c++ code---error 
Ethernet A- two statetements both wrong 
family tree-b+ 
dhcp-dynamic address genration 
dhcp address range-scope 
a==a*4; a<2  A- reduction in strength 
C code- A-  file a 2nd line error 
table is dropped, nonunique index will be dropped(check) 
 
Aptitude were damn easy…..you will be able to solve most of them, except below 3 no one should create any problem.

 

1. recursion ----120

2. div by 423----ans d-60…

3.

arrangement C , D, F
