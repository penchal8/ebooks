Subject: [CHETANA] I got through INFOSYS - some tips for infy aspirants


hello friends,

i took the infy test on 6th july(Chennai,Afternoon).
i didnt get any mail from INFY...
so i called up INFY banglore 1 week back and they said that 
i have cleared the test and i'll be intimated officially in 2/3 weeks.

i thank the owner,the moderators and all members of chetana-jobs group 
for circulating old infy question papers and for their valuable suggestions.

then for infy aspirants....i prepared from the following books

1.puzzles - shankuthala devi
2.more puzzles - shankuthala devi
3.mind streching puzzles - terry h.stickles
4.critical reasoning puzzles - norman d.willis
5.brain teasers - george summers
6.gre barrons(analytical reasoning)

i prepared analytical reasoning from 14th edition...
in the test i got a 8 mark anlytical question...
i found it to be difficult...
then i came to know that it was a question from 10th edition of barrons.
alaytical question are difficult in older editions of barrons.
so i would suggest infy aspirants to prepare anals from old editions of barrons.

after very good preperation if u find that the question paper is difficult...
dont lose heart...do whatever u know...
when the question paper is tough the cut-off will be low and there 
is every chance that u may get thro'....
so attempt the test with full confidence...

for english part no preparation is needed as only very basic questions are asked....

then very rarely only questions get repeated in INFY tests
(if u r lucky enough u may get questions repeated)...
so first be prepared with the books....
then go thro' all question papers to have a feel of the test....

ALL THE BEST to all INFY aspirants and other freshers hunting for a job..


this was the question paper i got in the test

the common stock". Find the value of the common stock.
