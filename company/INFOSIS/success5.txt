hi i am jayakrishna did B.E(E.E.E) in chennai.

Before telling you my success story let me eloborate my failure story.
i attended following companies and coudn't even clear aptitude test.

infosys
polaris
MBT
hexaware
accenture
virtusa
L cube
aspire systems
protechsoft
ingersoilrand, bangalore
wipro spectramind
sutherland
STC technologies
Alstrom
and many more......................

after losing so many companies i finally got in to INFOSYS that i
wrote for second time
so be confident and never lose your heart. i am a perfect example for
this.After losing nearly 15 to 20 companies i got in to infosys.

I prepared shankuntala devi's PUZZLE TO PUZZLE YOU and MORE PUZLES and
also many previous test papers.

I prepared nearly 3 to 4 hours a day for about 10
days and finally my hardwork paid.

Hope this letter could motivate you all.

Finally I thank this opportunity to thank chatana for the excellent
job this group is doing in brining all job seekers into one platform
and providing job opportunities and
assistance.I have downloaded infosys question papers from chetana only.

with regards,
Ch.Jayakrishna
