I had attende Kanbay test long back.

They had three sets of papers..to ensure people dont copy.

But generally the problems are te same.

There are two sections ...Aptitude and Maths.

Aptitude is easy but time is a major constraint.In maths all I remember is there were problems on

1)Compound Interest (3 or 4)

2)Two taps are filling a tank and the third one is emptying it .. sort.

3)Problems on trains

Maybe RS AGarwal will help a lot.In aptitude there were problems on RELATIONS

and on triangle area..Like

One equilateral triangle is divide into say into 3 equilateral traingle.What is the area proportion of the outermost to the innermost?

It was easy but one FALLS SHORT ON time.Practise a lot and I am sure you'll get through.
