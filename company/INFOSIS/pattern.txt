Many of you asked me how to prepare for the exam. So,
I am writing this mail.
Actually when I started preparing for this exam, I
browsed through mails in chetana group and I found one
mail from Nitya Monica. I would like to personally
thank her for writing such a wonderful mail.
I am again writing the same mail for all of those who
are preparing for infosys.

Infosys gives atleast 10days time between the written
test and when we get the call for written test.
I got call for written test in the first week of june
and my test was on june 19th. So I had 10-11days to
prepare.

first two days shakunthala devis more puzzles. some
300 questions are there i believe. i finished all the
200 questions in 2 days.
second 2 days shakunthala devi's next book. some 150
questions .i finished all the 150 questions. then for
the next 3 days george summers book. i was much
worried because i wasnt able to solve even a single
question. so i juz read the question , understood the
question, and then straight i went to the solution. i
completed his book in three days. then some old
question papers from internet. then in the remaining
three days i revised the 3 books so that i remembered
how to solve the puzzles. by doing this revision i was
able to solve the questions in the old infy papers.

Some people mailed me that they just have 2 days left.
I suggest them to just go through this years infosys
question papers (many papers are there in chetana
group) and just go through old question papers.

In my next mail I will tell you how to go about with
infosys interview.

All the best to all of you
