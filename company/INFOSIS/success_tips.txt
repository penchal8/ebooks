Hi Infosys aspirants

 

        Find herewith the collection of Infosys papers from various sources. I think this is a pretty good collection. What I thought is in the recent days you need to clear more than eight or some times even ten out of ten too. Some times (For your bad luck) out of the ten questions one you will get a real tough one. Bcoz of this most of the people get their way back. So you should have a look into as much as problems from the previous papers and from the various books. If you know at least the answer you can fill the steps of deriving the answers.

 

You should be time bounded while working on the problems. This will help you in the test.

 

I have some more set of sample papers. That i will post in the next time. If you have a test you can ask for some tips or for the latest papers. If I am able to get that I will forward it to you. I will try for that, but you should give me at least 5-6 days time.

 

Work on these papers. Try to understand the way of solving a particular problem. Try to apply it.

                                            ALL THE BEST.
