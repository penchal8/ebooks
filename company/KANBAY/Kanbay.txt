Hai People,

Iam a silent member of the group ... just wanted to inform u allabt the pattern
of Kanbay
I had attended the test of Kanbay yesterday (08.02.04) at The Institute of
Engineers, Khairtabad.

The pattern is as follows:

It has 2 sections - Reasoning & Maths (Both Pure & Quant) with 1/2 mark (-)ve
marking, duration of the paper is 60min (But is definetely a factor)

1) Reasoning --> It had 30 Q's ... & the cut off is 12 marks

They had covered almost every topic of reasoning ... specially from the book
"Verbal Reasoning" by R.S.Agarwal ... I cud find many Q's from that book ...
some of them are ... 

a) They give a big series of letters viz. DOQOOQPOQ ... & ask how many O's are
there in this series which are immediately followed by Q's but not immediately
preceded by D. The Question might look simple ... but when u start observing the
series ... it deos strain ur eyes ... 

b) 4 people A,B,C,D stand at the corners of a square ... they start moving in a
clock-wise direction. They stop when they cover 4 sides (its not clear whether
... each covers 4 sides or on the whole they cover 4 sides) ... which of the
following is true ... & they give choices abt the directions of them ... viz. B
is west of A ... etc ... 

c) 2 questions on relationships ... viz. B is the son of C but C is not the
mother of B ... so on ... its answer is "Uncle" ... better read the Q completely
& then answer ... 

d) alpahabet series ... abaa_ _abbbaa_ _ _ aaa ... so on ... 

e) A word is coded using some logic ... & he asked How'ld the PLEASE be written
in the same language.

f) 2Q's on Data Sufficeincy

g) 2Q's on Statements & Conclusions ... they give 2 statements ... viz. Some
cats are black & Some black are good ... its followed by 4 conclusions ... & u
hv to select which one is true ... so u hv check out whether those statements
are Universal Affirmative, etc ... well both are Particular Affirmative ... & u
need to deduce the Conclusions based on some rules (which are clearly mentioned
in RS Agarwal) ... 

h) No Synonyms & Antinyms ... 

i) One Q on ranking like ... A is 7th from the left & B is 11th from the left
... & so on .. 

2) Then comes the 2nd Section of Maths ... this is one real time-consuming one
... (30 min). Some of the  Q's  are ... & cut-off is 12 for this section also

a)42:84::52: ?

b)In a game of billiards A gives B 10 of 80 & B gives C 20 of 90 ... so how much
can C give B in such a game?

c) One Q on SI ... quite a strange one ... like father takes a loan ... &
distributes the amount ... it sums upto ... something ... after a couple of
years ... I dont remeber the Q exactly ... 

d) A cube of side 22cm ... some bullets of some side are made out of it ... how
many are made ?

e) In a garrison ... of some men for whom the provisions might last for 24 days
if they consume abt 340 gms per person. If some more people are added to the
garrison & each comsumes abt 250 gms ... how many days will the provisions last
... ( I am not sure abt the figures ... but the pattern is the same ... this Q
is there in RS Agarwal - Quant)

f) One problem on ages ... like they said that 4 friends of which one is younger
to the other ... & he asked who is the eldest ... the answer cant be deduced coz
the data is not sufficient ... 

g) One problem on avg.velocity ... 

h) one problem on Trains ... 

This is all I remember ... the paper is  a standard one ... but time-consuming
... My suggestion is ... dont attempt all the Q's ... but just attempt those
which are a bit easy & see to it that u cross the reqd mark of 12 safely ... 

I guess this'ld be helpful for those who appear for Kanbay to solve the paper
... But I culdnt understand the strategy of selection of the company ... he said
that 24 out 60 ... is the qualifying mark ... but he had hardly selected 12-13
people from each batch of abt 200-220 people ... there were abt 3 such batches &
one the whole the number wudnt hv crossed 40 ... 

Bye ... & All the best ...!!!
