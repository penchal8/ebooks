Subject: [CHETANA] (INFO) Details of IBM test


Hi everyone

Many of you had written to me and asked me a lot of questions. So I 
thought I would send the mail directly to the group. I hope this mail 
answers most of your questions.

Some of you have sent your resumes to me. Please do not send me any 
resumes, as I am just a new joinee.

I have done my MCA and passed out in 2003. I have an aggregate of 
around 82%.
I attended the IBM test in Bangalore on 9th august 2003. I had 
applied in June 2003 and got a call on August 4th. I have been placed 
in Bangalore itself. I think it takes time in IBM for your resume to 
get processed. 

The test consisted of 40 qs. A time limit of 60 min was given. It had 
20 aptitude and 20 technical qs.
For the aptitude part, if you prepare from R.S. Agarwal, that is 
sufficient. And for the technical part, the questions were from a 
wide variety of subjects including OS, DBMS, C++, Software 
Engineering etc.

The questions which I remember I have written below. 

1.      How many times do the hands of the clock coincide in a day?
Ans: 24

2.      A question on time and work

3.      qs. on speed and distance

4.      five qs on sectors. In a pie chart the sectors were given in 
terms of percentages. Various questions were asked on it.

For e.g. 







For each of these divisions the percentages was mentioned and 
something similar to the following questions were asked.

If 105 was scored, find which subject it is?

If the difference between Maths and Science is 25 which other 2 
subjects have the same difference?

5.      Software Configuration Management process is -----------------
---

6.      Data Integrity constraint is ---------------------------------
--

7.      Paging is ------------------------

8.      What is the output of the following program

main()
{
   printf("%u", main);
}


After the written test, I had a technical cum HR interview.

In the technical part, they asked me a lot of questions on my final 
semester project. They also asked me questions on DBMS, SDLC, OOPS 
concepts etc.

The questions which I remember are

1.      What is the most important thing in database design?
2.      Explain normalization technique as u would explain to a 
common man? 
3.      What are the steps in SDLC?
4.      Which is the most important step in SDLC?
5.      Is documentation a waste of time?
6.      Draw a flowchart to find a number from an array.
7.      What is error detection and where will u do it?

As for the HR part they asked me questions on my background. They 
also gave me a couple of situations like

if u get an offer from the 3 top companies which one would u choose?
After u joined IBM if u get a better offer from another company what 
will u do?

I hope this mail has helped many of u.

Thara
