anagrams and coding
-------------------
* 2 sequences of pair of ABC were given and u have
to find the 2nd of the pair of next sequence.
( some are mirror images so go for it).

* Consists of anagrams and SOLVE THIS FIRST these can
fetch you marks easily.ababab coded to bababa then
what is cacaca coded to......?same type only.
* based on coding of alphabets(simple)
practice rs aggarwal reasoning for this
* had meaningful words whose anagrams are nouns and
we hav to choose the best adjective from the list to
describe this noun:

* THIS IS PERHAPS EASIEST OF ALL SECTIONS.
8 QUESTIONS ON FOLLOWING TYPE.
EG:if ABABCB is BABABC Then AAABCB IS
A)AABCAB B)... C)... D)AABABC
ANS:d(take 2 letters and reverse them) 
i.e a sequence of alphabets are rearranged in an order you have to 
find that order and apply to the word.

* if abacbb corresponds to bbcaba & acbbca corresponds
to acbbca then baabcb corresponds to what.
ans-bcbaab.(reverse order)

*what they did in each question was either rotated the 
full word clockwise by 1 .

like if abcbac corresponds to bcbaca & acbacb
correspnds to cbacba then abcabc corresponds to what.
ans-bcabca.
this was easy,do it properly.   

*1. If  two conditions are being applied simultaneously the you will get same answer.
e.g
….suppose AAABBB
…Apply 34& 34 then the result will be AAABBB
