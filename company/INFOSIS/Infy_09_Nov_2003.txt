Hi all,
This is jharni,a silent member of this group but i think i should break this silence.
well
I am giving the question paper of 9th nov.May be some question will get repeated.
I know its quite late but i think better late than never.
I had written the test on 9th november. 
I have tried to  put the puzzles in the same language as they were actually.
I had solved 9 puzzles correct and the one (5th  half- had formed the equations but time didn't permitted me to solve ).

These were the questions from the puzzle part.

1.         I spent one-sixth of my age as a boy and one-12th in youth,remarked the boss"spentone-seventh and five yearsin matrimony".My son born just after that period was elected as a governor 4 years back when he was half of my present age.
what is the age of the boss?
ans:-84

2. A girl had several dollars with her. she went out for shopping and spent half of them  in shopping mall,being generous she had given 1 dollar to the beggar. After that she wqent for lunch and spent the half of the remaining and gave 2 dollars as tip to the waiter.Then she went to watch a movie and spent the half of remaining dollars and gave autorikshaw-wala 3 dollars.

5. A bargainhunter bought some plates for  $ 1.30 from asale on saturday,where price 2 was marked off at each article .On monday she went to return them at regular prices,and bought  some cups and saucers from that much amount of money only.
the normal price of plate were equal to the price of 'one cup and one saucer'.
In total she bought 16 items more than previous. saucers were only of 3 cents hence she brought 10 saucers  more tahn the cups,
How many cups and saucers she bought  and at what price?

6.Two marbel  shooters. One gained 20 marbles more than other  ,but to play off he lost  two-third of his marbles leaving the other with the 4 times more of the marbles the one had at the end of the play.
