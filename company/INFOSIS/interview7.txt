Dear Chetana mam and the Chetanites,

Finally i got placed in my Dream company dream company Infosys. I
attended the test on June 19th and the interview on june 20th and
got my call letter and am askd to join Mysore on July 25th. Many of
my friends in my class were placed thru on campus recrutiments and i
was among the few who seemed to be having bad luck .I was very
depressed in the beginning but I never lost hope.This was my 9th
test. I used to study really hard for all thses exams, but the
difference was that for the last one I studied harder.I had the
motivation of all my friends and my parents.
I wud like to list my attempts towards job
hunting.

(2)TCS- didnt go thru the test

(3)Satyam-got out in HR/TECH

(4)Subex- didnt go thru the test

(5)Hexaware- got out in HR/TECH

(6)IGate- got thru the first round but failed in
the second

(7)Verizon- didnt go thru the test

(6)Honeywell- didnt go thru the test

(9)Infosys- Got thru the whole process and Have my call Letter in
Hand

As u can see i had to face lot of failures still i didnt
give up.I got all the inspirations from the mails that were send to
this group by the members. I really wanna thank this group for
putting up the latest question papers .Thses papers were very
useful. There is also one post regarding the 7 day schdeule for
preparing for Infosys. I followed that, and added my own too. I
shall be posting my way of preparation in the next post .Thanks
again everyone.
Thank you Chetana Mam for this wonderful group.

with luv and prayers, Rajiv
