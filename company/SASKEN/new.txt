hai my friends,
 
 
   i wrote the sasken test.
 pattern was
 30 questions
    10 on c
    10 on apti
    10 on dsp+communication
   c and aptitude was better but the communication paper is too tough for me.
      about c questions:
        2 questions from malloc
        2 using hexadecimal.
        1 using functions.
        2 in general about preprocessor,"sizeof (int)".
        2 from pointers.
  about aptitude:
        4 using r.s aggarwal
        2 using logical reasoning(but simple).
        2 in general(our old 10th maths).
   about communication paper;
        it is related with quantization levels,noise,modulation index,rayleigh 
i dont know more about this.....
 
 
  
good bye.
