Subject: [CHETANA] (Paper+Query) Infosys 7dec-bangalore paper


Dear Chetana Members,

 

First of all I would like to Thank Ms. Chetana and Mr. Suri for providing immense help to IT aspirants and professionals by forming this wonderful group. It's also nice to read the success stories from so many friends. I am silent member of this group for last 3 months, this is my second mail to the group, first was rejected. I received lot of information from the group and now it's my turn. I got a call letter for Infosys test on Saturday 6th December to attend a test on Sunday 7th at Pune. I attended the test in Bangalore center on the same day. 
 

Sending the question paper as I remember it, questions may not be in the same order as they appeared and sometimes in my own language. I cleared the test and was called for an interview on next day that's on Monday 8th at 2 PM at electronic city. When I reached there, they told me, I fall under the category of fresher and they have interviews for experienced people, As a fresher I need to give another test on English, which was of 30 mins duration, 45 questions. It was simple. Now I am waiting for the further communication from their side.

Regards,
Vishakha.
