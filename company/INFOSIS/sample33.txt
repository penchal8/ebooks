PART 1

1). A beggr collects cigarette stubs and makes one ful
cigarette 
with every 7 stubs.  Once he gets 49 stubs .  How many
cigarettes 
can he smoke totally.
                    Ans. 8
2). A soldiar looses his way in a thick jungle  at 
random  walks 
from his camp but  mathematically  in  an 
interestingg  fashion.  
First he walks one mile east then half mile to north. 
Then  1/4 
mile to west, then 1/8 mile to south and so  on 
making  a  loop. 
Finally hoe far he is from his camp and in which
direction.
ans: in north and south directions 
  1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128 + 1/512 - and so on 
               = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))
     similarly in east and west directions
    1- 1/4 + 1/16 - 1/64 + 1/256 -    and so on 
            = 1/(( 1- ( - 1/4))
  add both the answers
3). hoe 1000000000 can be written as a  product  of 
two  factors 
neither of them containing zeros
  Ans   2 power 9 x 5 ppower 9  ( check the answer )
4). Conversation between two mathematcians:
 first : I have three childern. Thew pproduct of
their ages is  36 
.  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my 
neighbour's 
door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan 
verfies  the 
door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then 
the  first 
says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the
youngest"
Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can 
you  aanswer 
the questoion asked by the first mathematician?
What are the childeren ages?        ans  2 and 3 and 6
5). Light glows for every 13 seconds .  How  many 
times  did  it 
between 1:57:58 and 3:20:47 am
     ans : 383 + 1 = 384

6). 500 men are  arranged in an array of 10 rows and
50 columns . 
ALL tallest among each row aare asked to   fall  out 
.  And  the 
shortest among THEM is A. Similarly after resuming
that to  their 
originaal podsitions that the shorteest  among  each 
column  are 
asked to fall out. And the longest among them is B .
Now  who  is 
taller among A and B ?
     ans  A  
7). A person spending out 1/3 for cloths , 1/5 of the 
remsaining 
for food and 1/4 of the remaining for travelles  is
left with
Rs 100/- . How he had in the begining ?
   ans    RS 250/-
8). there are six  boxes containing 5 , 7 , 14 , 16  ,

sold  one 
box out of them and then he says " I have the same
number of  red 
balls left out  as that of blue ". Which box is the
one he  solds 
out  ?
Ans : total no of balls  =  89 and (89-29 /2 = 60/2 =
30 
    and also 14 + 16 = 5 + 7 + 18 = 30
9).  A  chain  is  broken  into  three  pieces  of 
equal  lenths 
conttaining 3 links each. It is taken to a backsmith
to join into 
a single continuous one . How many links are to  tobe
