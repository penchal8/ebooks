DOMINOES
--------
* certain dominoes were given and u r supposed to
match the options fot the given fig.
(quite easy)
* Consista of dominoes and essentially deals with
numbers
and this is also tough.NO aptitude.Some arrangement in
a matrix of numbers.
based on dominoes

* 6 dominoes were given & target was given we had to
find the correct position of a specific domino ffom
the 4 options so that we can reach the target
* six dominoes were given, each having 2 numbers on one of its 
faces..the boundaries of the dominoes were immaterial.

this is an example of a given dominoe..the six dominoes had numbers 
(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(3,2),(2,2),(3,3)..i dont remember the exact 
numbers.the word "TARGET" had to be constructed from these 
dominoes.we had to find from a given set of arrangements which one 
was possible.
* then one question was on six block borders were given.
1 2 2 3 3 1
1 2 3 2 1 3
this was given in six different column blocks.
ques. was
if 1 2 3 2
2 3 2 1
1 3 2 3
3 2 1 2
then 1 2 - -
- - - -
- - - -
- - - -
corresponds to which of the block.four options were
given.all these things were in square blocks.
like this 10 questions were given.


HOW TO DO?

See the Dominoes pdf file (pg no 6 and 17)
see "cts_.doc" in this cts-black folder to see the figure)
Guess you have picked up how to do the dominoes .... Ok if you havent observed this .. let me tell you ... There are doublet dominoes in the question .. doublets are like (1,1), (2,2) etc ... look for these in the given square ( the target you have to acheive ). Most probably you will find only a single place where you can locate the doublets together .. that is u can find two 1's or two 2's (or two 3's) together only in one place in the given square ... Group them as a doublet and the rest will be easy for you ... Hope you understand ... Even if you dont ., dominoes are no big deal , just apply your mind .....
