STRINGS
-------
2 rules r given for  a certain string to be valid .
on that u have to solve 8 qs 
e.g find no of valid/invalid strings (quite easy ).
3 rules were given 8 qts were asked based on those
rules.
we had to find whether the string given was valid or
not based on those rules.

there were 3 synbols g,o,d .in the lang & x  y were
strings of Gs with atleast 1 g

	This also comprises similar type of ques.
But with someease.like xGyD  is a word then xGGyGGo
 ia also a validword and so find the number of valid words 
in the given set.Question may seem to be easy but very difficult if u attempt.It is very difficult the answer the first two sections.
his section had the funda of xOy where x and y
represented strings of Gs . The test was to find the
valid or invalid patterns with ref. to the rules

questions based on a set of conditions,we were given 6 conditions 
and were asked to find a valid set of words from agiven set of words.
1.if xogoy is a valid word,where x is a string of "g"'s consisting of 
atleast one "g",and y is also a string of "g"'s consisting of atleast 
one "g"....then gogog is avalid word.
gg0goggg is also a valid word...and so on
2.if xgogxoy is avalid word..where x is a string of "g"'s consisting 
of atleast one "g",and 
y is also a string of "g"'s consisting of atleast one "g" then 
ggogggog is avalid word...

and 4 more conditions were given

eg:find the no. of valid words in the following set if xogoy is the 
valid word
(gogog,godogg,gggogog)
ans:2
we come to the G-O-D(new language .. with only GOD as the 
letters, x and y are strings of Gs question... ) 
if xGOyGDxG is a valid word how many of the following are 
valid/invalid....

( GOGDG, xGOxGGGDxG, xGGGOyDxGGGG)

Here ... the second one is invalid .. and the rest are valid ... try 
and figure out
