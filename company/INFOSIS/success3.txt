Please approve this mail!!!

I want to share my success story with all of you.
I am a silent member of this group. I got placed in
C-DAC and also in Infosys. I am asked to join Infosys
on July25th at Hyderabad.

I would like to thank each one of this group,
escpecially to Chetana madam, for giving such a
valuable information. There was a mail which told how
to prepare for infosys.  I exactly followed that
approach and helped me a lot.

For all job-seeking freshers, I will tell just be
ready by preparing for aptitude test, as the interview
call might come at any time. There will be very less
time, to prepare after you get the call for written
test. So, you should be prepared well in advance. One
day before the written test, go through all the old
question papers. Atleast 20% of the questions will be
from old question papers. So, it is very important to
go through old question papers.
Be confident and never give up.

In my next mail I will write about my CDAC and Infosys
experiences.

Thank you and all the best.
