hi chetana ma'am,
       I am sakshi mittal. I have been a member of his group for about a year.
   Its helped me a lot. I have done chemical engineering and i just got a offer of employment from Infosys. thanks to this group i cleared the test as well as the interview only because of this group.
  This group rocks.
 guys i just want to tell u never loose hope.i cleared in 2004. but got placed only now. it dosent matters as long as u have hope.
if u clear the written test the interview is a cake walk.
 
they asked me
1)      fuel formula             i told them i dont know.
2)         asked me a puzzle               tried it out. could not get the final answer
he also asked how i travelled to their office
i told i got their by bus
thnk u  guys
 
 
3)asked me if  i was made the transport minister of india what would i do to solve bangalores traffic problem
   I told about the metro rails also told them it will take time. for immediate action  reduce the autos so that people travel by bus.
make it such that cars are not allowed in important streets so tha people travel by 2 wheeler. we cant force people so this is a subtle way of telling them.
 
 
while leaving the guy asked me to smile i told him i dont think i gave my interview well and i have a reason to smile abt it
 
i dont know if he meant i got it, but then yesterday i got my offer of employment.
