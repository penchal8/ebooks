hi,

      last month i attended an infosys exam.....though i couldn't do it well...i am sending how the pattern of paper was at that time.
It consisted of 9 questions(arithmatic and analytical reasoning 50 marks) and an essay.

          2 * 3m

          2 * 4m

          2 * 6m

          3 * 8m

      the test was hard and it consisted of  questions from puzzle books(like shakuntala devi's) and gre analytical questions.
      Over 800 students came to write the test at my center(chennai).

      v had 1hr time for the 9questions and 15 min for essay.

      i did a question(8m) wrong.the question  is as follows

          A man names ANYONE travels from ANYCITY to ANYWHERE to attend a marriage reception.

          After travelling for 2 hrs his car tyre gets punctured and it takes him 10 minutes to change the tyre.

          After that he travels the remaining distance at 30mph in order to play safe.

          he reaches the reception 30 mins behind the schedule.

          if the car tyre got punctured after 30miles he would havebeen 15 minutes behind the scheduled time.

          question:  how far is ANYCITY from ANYWHERE.?

      I dont know the answer and if anyone knows please tell me.

      Most of the questions are of this type and they didnot give me the question paper back.

      Coming to the essay(200 words)    it had 2 topics and v must select one.

              how has the credit facility changed the lives of people?

                                           or

              even though there is a growth in scientific knowledge,y is superstious still followed.

      I wrote the second one.

and if u want the question papers try www.placementpapers.com or try www.google.com

hope u write the exam well

good luck 

bye

Raju...
