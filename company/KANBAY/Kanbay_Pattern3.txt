posted a query regardin' the cut off of mbt. the cut off isnt 
predecided. they said its decided upon the relative performance of 
the candidates. the test was simple except for the rc. very less 
time....
a3b2=72, a+b=? ans=5
some eq like x@y=2x+7y, and find the value of....
missing no: 0,2,2,4,6,10,? these were simple.
series were regaring squares of nos....eg squares were either added 
or sub.
