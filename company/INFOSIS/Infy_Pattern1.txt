Subject: [CHETANA] (info) Ultimate information for cracking infosys test


Hi,

Here I have given all the information I know about
infosys test(based on sixth july exam).

Go through books and websites in the following order:

1.BrainTeasers by George summers.

2.Become a member of www.brainvista.com and go through
the puzzles and answers available in it.This one will
be very useful for you because it has a variety of
puzzles (about 600 in number with detailed answer).
you can also submit puzzles to them.Some puzzles in
the books specified here can also be seen here.

3.Visit www.englishclub.com (contains very primitive
information yet interesting)and click to grammar link
in it.It will be helpful for you to test and improve
your gramatical skills to some extent.

4.Puzzles to Puzzle You & More Puzzles by
shakuntalaDevi(2 books).

5.Brain teasers by RaviNarula.

6.Barrons GRE for problems and vocabulary(easy one not
that tough as in Barrons).

7.Go through any material for Comprehension(little
effort is enough in this one).

8.Go through any dictionary of confusables(like advice
- advise,Martial-matrial etc).

9.If you are not an English medium student WREN&MARTIN

High school english grammar (Tenses)will help you.

I came to know of these information only few days
before the exam it helped me a lot to crack .Ask any
one who has taken the test to confirm the information.


No need to try anything else to my prespective.

The information given here is lot more than enough to
crack infy written test.

All the best for your selection.

A.S.K
