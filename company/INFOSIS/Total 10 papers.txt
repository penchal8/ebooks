  On the Island of imperfection there is a special road,  Logic Lane, on   which the houses are usually reserved for the more mathematical  inhabitants.  Add, Divide and Even live in three different houses on this   road (which     has houses numbered from 1-50). One of them is a member of the   Pukka Tribe,
 who always tell the truth; another is a member of the Wotta   Tribe, who never   tell the truth; and the third is a member of the Shalla Tribe,   who make  statements which are alternately true and false, or false and 
 true.   
      They make statements as follows :

       ADD     : 1 The number of my house is greater than that of  Divide's.
                  2 My number is divisible by 4.
                 3 Even's number differs by 13 from that of one of the  others.
        DIVIDE  : 1 Add's number is divisible by 12.
                 2 My number is 37.
                3 Even's number is even.

       EVEN    : 1 No one's number is divisible by 10.   
                   2 My number is 30.

 The names of the inhabitants of Walkie Talkie Land sound  strange to the     visitors, and they find it difficult to pronounce them, due to  their   length and a few vowel sounds they contain. The Walkie Talkie 
 guide is      discussing the names of four inhabitants - A,B,C and D. Their  names
  each contain upto eight syllables, although none of the four  names   contain the same number. Two of the names contain no vowel  sounds; one       contains one vowel sound; and one contains two vowel sounds.
  From the Guide's statements below, determine the number of  syllables
 
       and vowel sounds in each of the four Walkie Talkie names :
 
       i)  The one whose name contains two vowel sounds is not A.
       ii) C's name does not contain more than one vowel sound or 
 fewer than     seven syllables.
       iii)The name with seven syllables does not contain exactly one  vowel  sound.
iv) B and C do not have names with the same number of vowel   sounds.
v)  Neither the name with five syllables nor the name with  seven syllables   contains more than one vowel sound.
vi)  Neither the name with six syllables, nor the B's name,   contains  two vowel sounds.
