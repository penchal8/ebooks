Subject: [CHETANA] (Job) got a job in INFOSYS

I am a silent member of this group n this is my first mail in the group.
Before starting, firstI want to give my heartily thanks to chetna mam and suri sir.

I received offer letter from infosys yesterday . I wrote my test on 12th of oct in delhi . They didnt specified the date and place of joining and told me to intimate that soon.
I want to share my experience regarding the test. when i got the call after that i started my preparation because the written call comes to you 2 weeks before and that is sufficient time for preparation.

I like to tell the memebers that dont take the call causually it needs sincere and thorough preparation .

the material u need for the preparation is :

1. fresherworlds all sample paper of the infosys - if u solve it thorougly it will b easy for u to clear the test because from these papers 2 or 3 puzzle come straight through and if you r knowing there answer it helps u to save time for the other problems

2. the other book is sakuntala devi - puzzle to puzzle u 
from this book u will surely get 2 or 3 puzzle in paper.

3. Ravi narula - this book consisting of some good puzzles which generally comes in paper so do this book also . from this u will get 1 or  2 puzzle

4 george summers this book is for the questions of reasoning .
this book will help u to practice the kind of the reasoning  questions that come in the paper but u have to solve these problems in paper at the time of the test only.

5 one more book sakuntala devi more puzzles u can do this also if u have enough time .
one site is there which consists of the latest papers of infosys

5. the problem that is in sakuntla devi - problem no 69 - the family matter.

6. the problem of 8 marks i didnt rememeber exactly but 
it was  about forming commitees and 4 subpart each of 2 marks were given

7. A,B,C,Dand E are juniors and F,G,H,I are seniors you have to make three groups each containg three person such that in each group one senior is there and some other conditions which i cant recall exactly but was like that if this person will be in group than this cant be in the same group .

8. there are 100 teams in a football knockout tournament how many mathces should be held to get the winner answer is 99 ie one less than the no of teams bcoz in every match on team goes out

the other i dont remember.
try to attempt all the questions and make sure that atleast 9 of them are true 
because infosys cutoff goes high .
this is all for the members of the groups who are hunting for job.

I want to thanks chetna mam and sir once again for there gr8 efforts for us members.
