Hi all
I think many friends need the info of ST telephonics
interview.I attend this interview today. It was just
more then normal interview.First of all it depend on
for which group u are going for interview i opt for
software. So i will tell u about that.There main
concern on the COMPUTER ALGORITHUNM . u should be
master in this GO for coreman H. sahanee and somemore
good book.As well as if u should be familier to the AI
algo. be prepare for that Algo will be the key factor.
go in deep as much as possible.Then try to go in deep
C++ not much but concept should be strong (me thay
asked only virtual fun and data abs & poly ). u should
have little bit knowledge of eletronics digital
ofcourse. DS  strong . Thay will surely ask about all
sorting algo sure sure.if interview is 40 or more then
this then there is ur chances . so be prepare for
this.
