22.  Grass in lawn grows equally thick and in a uniform rate. It 
takes 24 days for 70 cows and 60 days for 30 cows to eat the whole 
of the grass. How many cows are needed to eat the grass in 96 
days.?
                Ans : 20
                       [Hint:     g - grass at the beginning            
                            r - rate at which grass grows, per 
day
                                    y - rate at which one cow 
eats grass, per day          n - no of cows to eat the grass in 96 
days
                                    g + 24*r = 70 * 24 * y              
                             g + 60*r = 30 * 60 * y
                                    g + 96*r = n * 96 * y,  
Solving, n = 20. ]

rail route 46 additional tickets have to be printed.
      Find N and X.
                Ans. x=2  and N=11   ( Let initially, N(N-1) = t; 
After adding,  (N+X)(N+X-1) =  t+46;Trail and  error method )
