Subject: [CHETANA] KANBAY PATTERN


hi all..

I am getting a lot of enquiries about the Kanbay
pattern.... I will tell you whatever I know...

I wrote this paper long back - March 12th to be exact.
It was a walkin.  There were no Technical questions
till the last interview... so guys.. put your heads
down and work on your speed and accuracy... Most of
the ques were of the type you see in Agarwal(quants).
Analytical is of medium toughnes.. That too tests your
speed and accuracy (not like the stupid stuff infy
throws at you ). There is negative marking(1 mark for
a correct answer and -1 for wrong). So concentrate on
accuracy... They shortlisted around 160 from the more
than 3000 who wrote the test. Then we had gds in
batches of 10. From every batch an average of 2 ppl
were shortlisted. Then we had an interview chaired by
both hr and tech ppl (30 - 45 mins). Well I got
chucked out at that point (At that time I did not know
even C properly).  Thats all I know....
ALL THE BEST Guyzzz!!!!

Kiran
