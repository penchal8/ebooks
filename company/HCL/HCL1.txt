Recruitment Pattern  

                    The test has four sections and 
               1.     Basic computer concepts
               2.     c questions
               3.     c analysing
               4.     Logical reasoning and aptitude                                                                  Freshersworld.com
           The four sections are quite easy see ,the forst section contains basics in os,architecture  then c questions are
       basic "what is the output of the following" then c analysing will ask u tricky questions about using pointers and
       structures .the 4th section is a combination of aptitude ,problems on time and speed ,then logical reasoning
       questions are more. thats all then if u qualify then almost u r into the company ,the hr interview will be questions
        both technical and personal. an important thing is that the written test is evaluated for each section each section
        has a cut off u pass thru the written test only if u gain the cutoff in all sections.
