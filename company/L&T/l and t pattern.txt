Subject: [CHETANA] (PATTERN)L&T infotech 

This had come earlier in Chetana Groups.The l&t infotech has 2 sections aptitude 
and technical.You nedd clear both to get to the GD stage.The aptitude generally 
consists of picture puzzles.It will be easy.The technical section is based on 
comp.sci and MCA syllabus.It will contain questions asking us to find output of 
programs in C,C++,JAVA.It will also contain question on data structures,os and 
algorithms.Hoping this helps. 

All the best.

Subject: [CHETANA] (pattern) L&T infotech 


THE PAPER IS IN TWO PARTS
iN THE FIRST ONE THERE ARE 40 QUESTIONS OF VISUAL
REASONING AND IN SECOND THERE ARE 50 QUESTIONS FROM
MISCELLANEOUS 30,40 TOPICS

Question paper is here:
Ok GUYS,
so i attended the L&T test today with all the valuable info that so many
of u had provided to me. Well ,now 4 the info.
The paper pattern is the same that was mentioned by all those ppl who
helped me.
Part 1:-> Psychometric test.
Easiest thing in the world. Eight figures with you having to
predict the ninth. Just use some common sense and u r thru this
test. A WORD OF CAUTION tho; plz. do not waste time on a question
if u r not sure ,just come back later n then do it. (36questions-
40minutes.)
Part 2:-> Engineering syllabus based Technical Test
Now this sectin is a bit tricky.
WARNING: Absolutely do not waste time on any question. U hardly
get any time to think. (40 questions n 30 minutes.)
Some of the questions r a s follows:-

a) What is reverse engineering.
b) Octal of some binary number(comes to 165 in decimal after
conversion).
c) A cobol prog with an integer array(I guess coz i did not have
Cobol in my syllabus).
d) A problem on Depth first search(very simple).
e) Question on Grammar's frm Theory of computer science.
f) Something like Select the correct option when
A Subset of (B Subset of ( A Intersection B)
if B is completely contained by A.
g) A question on memory(quite simple).
h) A couyple of questions on C(one on pointers).
These r all I can remember.


Next round was the GD.
By the way out of the 21 ppl who attended the test with me only 9
including myself were selected.The GD was amere formality i guess.
We were given the topic "Do u think women make better managers?"
A debatable topic , but we merely agreed with each other and no big
problem with it.


All these are collected from previous mails. In turn do me a favor. i
submitted my resume in monsterindia long back & now i even got a mail from
them to renew account. i did so. but till now i didn't get even 1 job mail
from them. while i receive well from naukri etc. will they deliver directly
to our e-mail id as others or else we have to go their site to
check jobs. kindly help me in solving this problem.

Wishing u all a very good luck in your endeavors. but don't forget to
respond to this mail. u mail me at nrkanna@vsnl.net


Adieu.

With Luv,
N.Khanna
