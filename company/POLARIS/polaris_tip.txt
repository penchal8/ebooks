hello friends,
  the attachments consists of polaris question paper
that was held today for various 
colleges today. around 6 colleges participated and the
test was conducted in 2 sesions.
wat ever the attachment contains, are the questions
from the first session. hope the 
same questions were repeated for the second session.
   there are two files. the one with the name "fresh"
is today's paper. that paper
consists of few questions and not all the 70
questions.
if u go thru the question paper u will get an idea of
the pattern. hope fully lets also
expect the same pattern.
i will like to add some few comments from the students
who wrote the exam today.
there were 70 questions. 
first 10 questions are from english and just go thru
the barron's
the next 60 questions were apptitude and analytical
reasoning. those questions were simple 
and was very much similar to the questions in 
"quantitive apptitude by R S Agarwal"
for analytical reasoning
look into the puzzle section from the book
"Verbal and Non verbal reasoning by R S Agarwal"

the important point to note is who ever gets 60 and
odd questions right were selected
for the GD. followed by it there is personal interview
round where u may expect it to be 
technical too. 
at last overall 550 students attended the test in the
first session and only 8 got thru 
for GD.
the compensation announced is 2 lakhs per annum. hope
this might change for us.
i hope these little informations will definitely help
u all.
ALL the very BEST.
bye for now.
EVS.
