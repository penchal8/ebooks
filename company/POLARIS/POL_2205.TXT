Pattern and Questions of Polaris Test help on 22nd May.

Technical Section: 40qns in 30min

It covered basics of almost all ece subjects like abt transistors, digital & microprocessors, communication,microwave etc...but qns were only basics nothing in deep... all qns had choices...

1. qn abt transistor..basic workin
2. boolean expn was given for simplification-simple
3. How many flags does 8085 have? (ans-5)
4. which of the following are universal gates?
(ans-nand,nor)
5. whts the frequency range of mobile communication?
6. the resolution of picture in tv depends on..
a. no: of lines scanned
b. video detector o/p
and 2 more choices were given...
7. qn on stability of FET
8. wht is the modulation used to transmit sound in tv signal

b. FM
and 2 more choices were there...
9. wht is double integration of a unit step signal?
a. ramp signal
b. parabola
dont remember the other 2...(ans-b)
10. qn abt spectral density-basic
11. qn abt basics of finite fourier transform(FFT)..it was something abt 8pt FFT...don't remember exactly...but if u know the definition u can do...

I am not able 2 memorize the rest frenz...but there were few more qns on transistors...

Aptitude Section: 30qns in 30min...all qns had
