hello friends,
iam suman from rvce.i couldnt get in cts.they
shortlisted 48,finally they took 14.they r fully going
on your performance in written.in our college highest
was 25 out of 40.so u can understand the level of
question.they have changed the pattern of question
this time. according to them it was gmat type.
they r giving 3 sets of paper.each of them r
different.
in my paper 1st question was from function,
(a,b,c)- L(a) is if u delete 1st element from it
whatever is left.
(a,b,c)-L(b) is 1st element of the list.
if (a,b) &a r two lists then M(l1,l2) is ((a,b),a).
X(a,l)=a
=L(a)
=M(a,l)
y(a,l)=l 
=L(b)
=M(l,a)
based on this they gave 4 questions,most of the
answers were b.
there is negative marking of .25.
then they gave around 8 questins of this type,
if abacbb corresponds to bbcaba & acbbca corresponds
to acbbca then baabcb corresponds to what.
ans-bcbaab.
what they did in each question was either rotated the 
full word clockwise by 1 .
like if abcbac corresponds to bcbaca & acbacb
correspnds to cbacba then abcabc corresponds to what.
ans-bcabca.
this was easy,do it properly.
then one question was on six block borders were given.
1 2 2 3 3 1
1 2 3 2 1 3
this was given in six different column blocks.
ques. was
if 1 2 3 2
2 3 2 1
1 3 2 3
3 2 1 2
then 1 2 - -
- - - -
- - - -
- - - -
corresponds to which of the block.four options were
given.all these things were in square blocks.
like this 10 questions were given.
then at last they had around 8 questions like this
p--s--d- corresponds to what
1.utopian 2.convince 3.pervade 4. 
ans- convince.-persuade.
one was perverse.
decadent(not sure).
sorry i couldnt manage much.

written.
they r taking even the guys who r not good in
technical stuff but is intelligent.
