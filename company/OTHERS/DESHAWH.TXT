                        SECTION-A

 you should write the programs for the following problems in C.

1. swapping two variables x,y without using a temporary variable.

2. a program has been given asking to find the output ans. it is algorithm for
finding G.C.D

3. write a program for reversing the given string.

4. the integers from 1 to n are stored in an array in a random fashion. but one
integer is missing. write a program to find the missing integer. ans. idea. the
sum of n natural numbers is = n(n+1)/2.
if we subtract the above sum from the sum of all the numbers in the array , the
result is nothing but the missing number.

5. some bit type of questions has been given on pointers asking to to find
whether it is correct from syntax point of view. and if it is correct explain
what it will do.(around 15 bits).

                        SECTION-B

   ANSWER AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

 6.& 7. two programs on pre-processor directions has been given asking to find
the output.

 8. simple question given on pointer
    a) kernighan & richie page no. 122
    b) schaum series  page no. 323
 try to understand the pointer problems given here he asked to explain in the
interview if answer it in exam.

 9. write a c program to find whether a stack is progressing in forward or
reverse direction.

 10. write a c program that reverses the linked list.

  GUIDELINES:
The interview is very tough he is asking to do the problems in front of him. he
is also giving some new problems to solve before him. you should have a very
good funda of C language.
