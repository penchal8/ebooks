allegation and mixture
a's concentration is 10%,b's 20%,c's 30%. The liquids are mixed in the ratio 1:2:3.the resultant concentration of the mixture is 23%.find each's concentration.(I am not sure about the numbers) 

 time and distance
in a 100m race 'a' is ahead of 'b' by 10feets.if the speed  of b is increased by 3m/s she is ahead of 'a' by 10feets in 120m  race.find the speed of 'a'

a)compilation error 
b)runtime error
c)work properly
d)

char *p;
int b;
p=&a;
b=*p++;
printf("%d",b);                                                                                      Freshersworld.com

If there is a global variable defined in another file is it necessary to define it again in the current program.
