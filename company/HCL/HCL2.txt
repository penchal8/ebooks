3.  Here is the structure declaration of a doubly linked list
       struct dlink {
       int nodeid;
       struct dlink *next;
       struct dlink *prev;
        } dlink_t;
       A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained as a global variable, whose definition is dlink_t *head; The funtion
        remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to remove the node pointed to the rp and adjust the head. The first node's prev
        and the last node's next are NULL. remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
           {
               rp->prev->next = rp->next;
               rp->next->prev = rp->prev;                                                                                   Freshersworld.com
              if( head == rp)
              head = rp->next;

            }     Which of the following statement is true about the fution remove_element
          a) It work when head is the same as rp
          b) It does not work when rp is the last element on the list
         c) It sets the head of the list correctly
         d) It works in all cases
            Answer :B) It does...
4.  Consider the following function written in c:
              #define NULL 0
              char *
              index(sp,c)
              register char *sp,c;
               {
               do {
                    if(*sp == c)
                       return (sp);   
                       } while (*sp++);                                                                                         Freshersworld.com
                      return NULL;
                          }
            The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string. The second argument, c, is a character. This function scarches
            for the character c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that location is returned else NULL is returned. This
             function works 
              a) Always
              b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the character  c
              c) works when c is a non NULL character only
              d) Works only when the character c is found in the string
             ans: a
