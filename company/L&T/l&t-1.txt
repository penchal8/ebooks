hello babitha, bhavik, hemali and sushma, (and all the others who have been mailing abt L&T)
 
i do not have any id of L&T because i went for their walkin in bangalore. Besides i am not an L&T employee, neither am i a part of HR of any company, so no use sending me ur resumes, biodata, CVs, phone numbers etc. NE ways another member, roopashree roopachetana@y...,  had sent the following mail to the group some days back. am pasting it here. hope it answers your questions. 
 
BTW Bhavik, do note that Mani(his mail has been attached at the end) has mentioned the name of the author for APM. no other books that i know of. i remember doing these type of problems in std.4 maharashtra state scholarship exams. they are very simple and do not require prepartion at all. 
 
hi L&T takers: hope this info I got frm gp hlps u all,here is the test pattern for SET(Software Engineer Trainee):

THE PAPER IS IN TWO PARTS iN THE FIRST ONE THERE ARE 40 QUESTIONS OF VISUAL REASONING AND IN SECOND THERE ARE 50 QUESTIONS FROM MISCELLANEOUS 30,40 TOPICS Question paper is here:
  
so i attended the L&T test today with all the valuable info that so many of u had provided to me. Well ,now 4 the info.
The paper pattern is the same that was mentioned by all those ppl whohelped me.

Part 1:-> Psychometric test.
Easiest thing in the world. Eight figures with you having to predict the ninth. Just use some common sense and u r thru this test. A WORD OF CAUTION tho; plz. do not waste time on a question if u r not sure ,just come back later n then do it. (36questions- 40minutes.)

Part 2:-> Engineering syllabus based Technical Test
Now this sectin is a bit tricky. WARNING: Absolutely do not waste time on any question. U hardly get any time to think. (40 questions n 30 minutes.)

Some of the questions r a s follows:-
a) What is reverse engineering.
b) Octal of some binary number(comes to 165 in decimal after conversion).
c) A cobol prog with an integer array(I guess coz i did not have Cobol in my syllabus).
d) A problem on Depth first search(very simple).
e) Question on Grammar's frm Theory of computer science.
f) Something like Select the correct option when A Subset of(B Subset of(A Intersection B).if B is completely contained by A.
g) A question on memory(quite simple).
h) A couyple of questions on C(one on pointers).

By the way out of the 21 ppl who attended the test with me only 9 including myself were selected.The GD was  amere formality i guess. We were given the topic "Do u think women make better managers?"A debatable topic , but we merely agreed with each other and no big problem with it.

      1. 2 tests(analytical and technical)
analytical 1hr(50 qns) (COMMON FOR ALL BRANCHES)
technical 1hr(50 qns)  (DIFFERENT FOR EACH       
      STREAM(civil,ece,cse,mech,Ice)
            
( we have to write both paper.They will short list
based on cut off from both papers)
            
            2.GD(not for elimination process)

      2) (14 - 26) -> Quans
      3)  again english
      4) 2 analytical reasoning with sub divions
      5) 3 data intrepetation qns. with sub divisions
      TECHNICAL :( CSE pattern)

papers -2
1.APM-arithemetic progression matrices 36 questions -40 minutes
2.computer basis -like OP,UNIX,cobol,....(only basic questions )-40 
questions -30 minutes
for all branches the pattern is same
for APM they gave a booklet author-j.v.raven(not sure )very easy
even though those who didn't receive call letter after applying don't 
worry 
it will end in a walkin.
computer questions ex:why goto statement must be avoided,function of 
engineering reversal,
specification&design are related by (followed by venn diagram),some 
questions in pascal...
two c program using while and for staements,
