      The distance between Station Atena and Station Barcena is 90 miles. A train starts from Atena towards Barcena. A bird starts at the same time from Barcena straight towards the moving train. On reaching the train, it instantaneously turns back and returns to Barcena. The bird makes these journeys from Barcena to the train and back to Barcena continuously till the train reaches Barcena. The bird finally returns to Barcena and rests. Calculate the total distance in miles the bird travels in the following two cases: 
      (a) The bird flies at 90 miles per hour and the speed of the train is 60 miles per hour. 
      (b) the bird flies at 60 miles per hour and the speed of the train is 90 miles per hour

         Answer and Explanation. 

   1.

         F + C + T = 100-------------eq1
         15F + C + 0.25T = 100-------------eq2
         eq1=eq2 .solve to get F=3T/56 ;F=3,T=56,C=41
   2.

      a) There is no need to consider their meeting pt at all.the train has been running for 90miles/(60miles/hr)=1.5hrs.bird flies till train reaches destination frm strting pt.so bird flies for1.5hrs at the vel given(90).so dist=1.5*90=135miles 

       b)  time of train=1hr.so dist of bird=60*1=60miles

   3.

      (a) u don't need to sum it up.since it's a knock out only 1 person emerges winner finally.so15+1=16is answer.becos after15 matches finally we shud've 15losers and 1winner.

      (b)  49:its always one less than no of players as per the idea  given above.so no need to check okay cos its always true.ans is 49. 
   4.

       Let x= current age 
       4(x+4)+5(x+5)=10x ;so x=R 41 years
   5.

      37(x-y)=x^2-y^2. u no tht x^2-y^2=(x-y)(x+y).so (x-y) cancels on both sides to give x+y=37.so sum of unequal halves=37 which is the req answer.
   6.

      R ans:7 teams okay.for a match u need 2 teams.suppose there r totally 'n 'teams.
      Now uve to choose 2 teams out of 'n' teams.so answer =no of such choices=no. of possible combinations. So we've ans = nC2(ncombination2)=21;solve to get n=7.
      Sol: n(n-1)/2=21. so n=7.if u don't understand c the graph below
      each team plays no. of matches=no of teams ahead of it. One bar '|' represents one team.
      | | | | | | | ------------7 
      6 5 4 3 2 1 0 -----------21
      last team is written as 0 matches becos this team has already played with all other teams-hence sum of matches =6+5+4+3+2+1=21 which is correct only if no of teams =7

      2. 2(G-2)=J+2.
      solve these 2 to get 
      J=14
   8.

      a). Sol:each mky takes 8 min to eat a banana 

       b).ans:8m=48 m=6

      Use sets and venn diagram to solve such questions.a,b ,aub,anb etc.
      12=tennis+leave
      18=jog +leave
      so jog-tennis=6
      again jog+tennis=14.so solve and get jog=10,leave=8,tennis=4.so tot=22
  10.

      Ans= 32*2 + 30*2=124
