SOME TIPS AND INFO ABOUT INFOSYS PREP...

hi guys, 

infosys tests arent very difficult. but they require
some amount of preparation. all the sums are based on
fundamental class 10-12 concepts. very simple speed
distance problems. 

u need to follow the foll. books. these 3 books are
moooooooooooooore than sufficient. 


1. PUZZLES TO PUZZLE YOU - By SHAKUNTALA DEVI 

q.no.
2,3,11,12,17,23,27,37,38,45,51,63,66,108,117,124,128,130,145,148

2. MORE PUZZLES  - By SHAKUNTALA DEVI 

q.no. 
193,221,244,275

3. GEORGE SUMMERS BOOK


starte with the puzzles to puzzle book importance to
each and every question. genrally problems having
comaplex figures and 2-page questions will not be
asked. u need to give importance to the questions ive
listed above. more or less these questions are
reframed or the same concepts are tested. initially
when one starts preparing he may find it very
difficult. but i guess it wud be only a starting
problem. one shudnt get demoralised by this starting
problem. u can always refer to the solutions (only
after having tried ur best at solving them w/o help) .
at times the solutions may also sound a lil greek and
latin, but u need to spend time on it... u shud know
this book in and out. 

SPEED PROBLEMS, TRAIN PROBLEMS, SIMPLE PROBABILITY AND
PERMU-COMBI problems are frequent. 

once ur thro with PUZZLES TO PUZZLE YOU - By
SHAKUNTALA DEVI u can move over to  MORE PUZZLES  - By
SHAKUNTALA DEVI. most of the problems here are
repeated or rephrased from (PUZZLES TO PUZZLE YOU - By
SHAKUNTALA DEVI). 

then u can use the GEORGE SUMMERS BOOK. try working
out a 2-3 problems from the GRE BARRONS book -
analytical section - the ones with 4 subdivisions. -
any person who has taken up his/her  GRE can easily
help u loacte such questions in the book. these are
very simple questions. they dont involve much time or
thinking. and these always feature in ur test. they
are generally with 4 subdivisions carrying 8 marks on
the whole.

after all this is over u can move over to THE QUESTION
papers. start off with the latest available papers and
  then move on to the old ones. u have plenty of them
put up on the yahoo groups. . once ur thro with 4-5
papers itself, u'd have a clear idea of what problems
are asked and what fundas are tested. 

but REMEMBER NEVER START OFF WITH THE QUESTION PAPERS,
it will never help. 

take the exam witha cool-head. FAALTU KA TENSION will
never help u.  u shud be able to time urself.
initially scan the paper, if u come acros any stereo
type problem just finish it off phat-a-phat. it wud
boost ur confidence. then approach  the rest proble.s
dont get stuck anywhere. MBA aspirants (ppl who have
given CAT and mock cats) wud have an edge in this
paper timing stuff..

all the best guys...... i hope this helps u ppl.....

bye

luv

chit
