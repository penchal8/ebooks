 9) This is analytical question and almost every one who wrote exams felt this as the toughest one . it carries 8 marks and consists of 4 persons and 4 items related 2 them with nearly 11 comditions . it goes like this

 Like this every person will have 3 conditions each     [ 8 marks]

 Time is not sufficient 4 me so I haven’t gone thru another question it carrries 6 marks it is based on ranking given to 4 persons. This is also a previous question I guess

 Almost all questions are repeated so go thru all previous questions

 

The very next day I had 2 attend the Interview , they selected 133 students in written test out of nearly 1200 odd people made into 7 panels each consisting of 20 members

The interview is purely HR oriented and not even a single question related 2 computers is asked. they asked me nearly 6-7 puzzles and I could answer only 5 out of them. The puzzles are like this

 

1)      60-60=60  what can u derive from it?

 They asked me

     -How was the day?

     -did u had a nice lunch?

     -Tell us about ur family background

-         How can u maintain consistency in ur academics?

-         Did u learn anything New recently?
