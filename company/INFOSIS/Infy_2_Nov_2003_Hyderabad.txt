Yesterday my mother asked me to buy some stamps. Stamps are available 
in 2 paise,7paise,10paise,15paise and 20paise denominations. For 
three types of stamps I was asked to buy five of each. For the other 
two types of stamps. I was asked to buy six of each. Unfortunately I 
forgot which I was supposed to buy five of and which to buy six of . 
Luckly my mother had given me the exact money required to buy the 
stamps , Rs. 3.00 and the shopkeeper was able to give me the correct 
stamps. Which stamps did I buy?
