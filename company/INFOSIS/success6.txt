Hi friends,
 
        With God's grace and my parents blessings, I've finally made it into Infosys - my dream company...that too after 1 yr of long wait.
        
         Until yesterday I was longing to send "I've got my Dream Job" mail to this group. Today I got my interview result and am really happy to share my moment of joy with all of you.I am joining on June 20 @ Hyderabad.

         Thanx a lot to all the members who've shared their experience of getting their job and they all 've been my source of inspiration.

         I too want to share my experience and the things I learnt during the past 1yr of job hunt.I'm a 2004 passout and this is my 2nd attempt at infosys. Though the 1 yr was full of frustration, I've learnt an important lesson that make my life successful - that is
 
         Have Self-Confidence! U can definitely reach ur goal only if u believe in urself. U fail not bcoz u r incapable but bcoz u didnt make true efforts to exhibit ur potential. Each failure is just one step short of success. Have Self-Confidence irrespective of ur success or failure and make honest efforts to reach and push ur potential, then " U r Successful in Life ".
 
         I really cant express my gratitude to the selfless and helpful soul Chetana Mam and All the Chetanites who hav been behind the success of every chetanite. I think thats what defines a chetanite -- Having guts & faith to achieve the impossible and helping others to achieve  success.
 
         All the best to all those job searchers for a bright career. Hats off to everyone of u who 've shared their tips & experience in cracking infosys test and other company interviews!!!!
 
Thanks a LOT friends
Maha.
