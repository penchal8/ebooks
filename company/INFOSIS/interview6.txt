Hello,
         This is Manolina.I am very happy to inform you that I got selected in Infosys.My joining date is 25th july(Mysore).
 
          Firstly I would like to thank Chetana Madam and all the members of the group .I have been a silent member of chetana for about 5 months.
          I cleared the written test on 19th june and called for interview on 20th june (Bangalore). My interview went on for 7-8 mins.There were two interviewers.They asked me to tell about myself, my strengths and weaknesses.Then they gave me a situation....Suppose u r the team leader.One of ur team member is very efficient and he does his work very sincerely and gives u more output than the other two members.But the main problem is that he comes very late and leaves very early.Other 2 members complain to u against him .How will u solve it?  Then they asked me a puzzle(easy one).....There are altogether 70 heads and 140 legs .Tell the no. of cows and cowboys.Lastly, they asked me if  I have any questions.That's all.
 
         Best of luck to all those who are still trying.Don't loose heart.Always remember............. FAILURE IS THE FIRST STEP TO SUCCESS.
 
  Regards,
  Manolina Deb
