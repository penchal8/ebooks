Hi,
I joined in Infy Mysore. It is great to be here. It is around 312
acres of land and 300 acres more land is being added to the same
campus. My rooms are equipped with A.C's and all facilities. It is
graded as 7* room. We have a table tennis, volley ball, bowling
alley, swimming pool shettle court and all. In the campus itself we
have a super market. I am feeling it as if it is a dream. I met 15 to
20 people from A.P. We are issued Employee id's on the second day.
Right from the first day upto two days they are conducted classes
about infy and how to be here and how to decrease the Income tax
cutting of salary etc. On the third day they verified the
certificates and conducted one Group Discussion. The topic i got
was "Is U.S serious about the terrorism". It is just a informal G.D.

They provided number of cycles all over the campus. We can just take
them and can leave there we go in the campus.
The one thing most wanted to say is " This training is certified as 2
years M.S in U.S. The hard thing is we have to work hard even 20
hours a day. Any whay nice to be here. I thank god very much. I am
unable to access the messanger and gmail.
            bye
