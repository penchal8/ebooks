There was a transistor circuit given, you have to identify which gate 
it is: ans NOT gate

What kind of repeaters are used in optical fibres? ans: the light 
signal is converted to an electrical signal, then amplified, reconverted to 
light, transmitted.

An opamp ckt was given. Open loop gain was given, Rf and Ri were given.  
You had to calculate the gain of the ckt.

There was a ckt given with an LED in the collector arm. Find the value 
in the base resistance for the LED to glow.

There was a question on the transmission used in doordarshan. (dont 
remember it clearly)

A base 10 number was given to be converted to BCD.

There were 4 circuits given and asked which of them can be used to 
detect a pulse. ans: Schmitt trigger

Opamp ckt given and asked what it was : LPF

another opamp ckt given and asked what it is? ans: current to voltage 
converter

Opamp followed by diode. ans: this ckt acts as a rectifier

The slew rate of the opamp given as 2V/us . What is the max gain for a 
change of .5V in 10 us. ans : 40

Input to a black box is a square wave and the output is given as an 
impulse. What is the ckt? ans: differentiator (HPF)

A square wave is passed thru a RC filter. What is the output.

No of address lines were given in 8086. What is the no of memory 
locations?
