Subject: [CHETANA] I got thru POLARIS Software Labs


I got thru Polaris Software Labs. My interview was held on August 2nd 
on Tuesday and got selected as I received email today. The Persoanl 
Interview was very simple and they asked about my computer related 
knowledge. As I am presently working on Java, they asked about Java 
Servlets, Servlet Life cycleetc and some OOPs concepts, different 
types of printf statements in C...etc.

Groups is a greatest innovation by discovery by Yahoo and most 
importantly the people asociated with the groups. Every group is 
great. Chetana in the groups was simply outstanding. Eventhough, it 
did not anyhow help me to get this job directly, What it has 
succesfully maintained to me is my confidence and aspiration to get a 
good Job. Hats off!
