My dear Friends,
                             First of all, how u r all?Its my time to tell u all the good news related to me.I got job in INFOSYS my dream company.In this mail i want to share all my experience that has happened in this more than one year one month time.Plz spare some time on this mail.
                             We know that Failures are stepping stone for success.For me there are almost 30 stepping stones to reach the success.Really i dedicate the whole credit to my parents because they supported me in every field i went i.e either CAT or GATE or Development side.I cannot ever repay them.The whole period of my trails contains a lots of disappointments n frustrations and some happiness.
The exams(even i remembered the dates also) i went through the wholeperiod are :

INFOSYS [ June 29 ]--->RECEIVED MAIL OF APPOINTMENT
 
 

                               And now i will be trained as "Software Engineer" in INFOSYS.I was thrilled n excited by seeing the mail on 29th of june.
My disappointments came in all the exams in which i failed in written exams.
I was frustrated
--- when i failed in GATE 
--- when i failed in INFOSYS in written exam in my first attempt as i expected     the positive result.
---when i qualified in IIFT but was unable to go beyond it.
---when i didnt got any respond from CTS after performing well in intw
---when i didnt got any respond from FLEXTRONICS
---when i was sent out of CTS exam as i have less than 70%.At that time i     have only one opportunity as fresher and that is nothing but Infosys on     june 19th.If  i failed in cracking infosys i have to keep with fake experience
 
I felt happy
---when my sister got married in the month of December
---when my classmates are settling well, I thought that some or other day mera number bhi ayega.
     
                               The trailing period of  little ups and so many downs with rich experience in facing exams and good support from parents n frnds i was happy throughout.Anyway i reached the success step.
                            
                              Coming to my job,My reporting time is on 25th of this month and training will be in hyderabad only.Still i had a long way to go improve my career.Finally i thank god,parents,my frnds n well wishers.Especially i am thankful to Deva(ECE) for supporting during my infosys preparation and Pratap(Bachi) who is there with me throughout the process of infosys.
                               
                               I came across a definition of success in which i reached in the same way--
                              "Success is a long unpredictable road.However it is one that is worth in every slip,every slide and every fall along the fall.Success is the accomplishment of goals and objectives necessary to acheive a particular task,realize a particular dream for a particulat period of time. 
                                Success is a state of constant motion.It is in the sweat we put out,the lonh hours we put in,in the decisions we make n take and in the lessons we  learn as we striveto reach higher levels."
                            So guys n gals who are in job trails never ever give up.Improve your confidence n keep on doing your hard work n u will reach the success.luck will also favours you.ofcourse i believe in luck.i wish you all the best .
                                                                                regards
                                                                                D.Pavan Kumar
