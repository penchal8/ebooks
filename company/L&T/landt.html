MECHANICAL SECTION ONE *effect of temp. on viscosity*internal keyways <BR>
are made by: ans:milling3. M33*2 emplies what?4.how do u decides <BR>
fits5.core print=? 6.stroboscope use to measure what7.piezometer is <BR>
used to measure (a. static pr. b. vel. c. rate of flow d. total <BR>
pressure)8.turbine rotating at 3ooo rpm and balanced at 1500 <BR>
rmp........... 1. ratio of balancing speed to operating speed. 2. &quot; <BR>
sqrt(bl. speed / op speed) 3. &quot; sqr(bl speed )/op speed <BR>
4. ...............9. lap joint hoe many screws will be used.<BR>
(thickness was not mensioned)10 how do u decides hardning of guiode <BR>
way of m/c.11. stress conentration factor is affected by (couldn't <BR>
remember option) 12 why a punch is surface hardnend. SECTION TWO This <BR>
section checks the concepts of class 12th mechanics.All the question <BR>
contained figure.Just go through the very basic ideas of 1. gear <BR>
arrangement. along with pulleys and belt drives.2. different gear <BR>
arrangements.(external and internal)3. belt drives (open and closed) <BR>
u will be given combination of gear and belts. Direction of motion <BR>
ofone gear will be given and u have to predict the motion of other <BR>
gears. There are 8 to 10 problems like this. Then balancing of <BR>
masses . in this masses are hung on one side of lever, u have to <BR>
predict the balancing mass on other side of lever. Simple concepts of <BR>
projectile motion , moment of inertia, shape of water Coming out of <BR>
tank ……………… Simple concepts of wheel balancing. Though the problems <BR>
require very simple concepts but u will have to Think carefully <BR>
before selecting any option.U should maintain the speed. One question <BR>
on battery circuit. --------------------------------------------------<BR>
----------------------------------------------------- SECTION THREE <BR>
In this section 3*3 matrix was given.One box in the matrix was empty <BR>
nd u have to choose The answer among 8 options. Just see the <BR>
releationship existing between diffirent rows and columns And decide <BR>
the answer. Everyone can solve up to 20 , but after that it becomes <BR>
tough It seems that questions attemted after 20 were deciding. &gt; <BR>
SECTION ONE &gt; &gt;---------------------------&gt; &gt;these are the questions <BR>
which are asked in&gt; technical&gt; section .&gt; &gt;in total there were 46 <BR>
questions and the time given&gt; was 30 minutes.&gt; &gt;somebody was saying <BR>
that they have given the last&gt; year paper.&gt; &gt;after the questions i am <BR>

------------&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; THIS SECTION CONTAINS VERY LOGICAL QUESTIONS&gt; <BR>
BASED ON GEARS,PULLEY AND LIQUID PRESSURE.TOTAL 60&gt; QUESTIONS&gt; &gt; TIME <BR>
ALLOTTED IS 40 MIN THIS SECTION CONTAINS MANY&gt; FIGURES AND QUESTIONS <BR>
ARE ASKED BASED ON THOSE&gt; FIGURES.FOR EXAMPLE&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1]7 or 8 gears or <BR>
wheels are connected either&gt; directly or through belt drives.the <BR>
direction of&gt; &gt;motion of one gear is specified.and asked which all&gt; <BR>
other gear will rotate in the same direction.&gt; &gt; IT IS NOT POSSIBLE <BR>
FOR TO GIVE FIGURES FOR&gt; THESE&gt; QUESTIONS.THIS WHOLE SECTION CONTAINS <BR>
AT LEAST&gt; &gt;10 QUESTIONS OF THIS TYPE.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;2]10 QUESTIONS ARE BASED <BR>
ON WEIGHT LIFTING&gt; ARRANGEMENTS LIKE LEVER,CYLIDER WRAPPED WITH A <BR>
ROPE&gt; OPERATED THROUGH HAND CRANK,&gt; &gt;3-4 PULLEY ARRANGEMENTS,THE <BR>
MECHANISM USED TO LIFT&gt; THE ENGINES OF CARS.YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT IN <BR>
WHICH&gt; MECHANISM LEAST STRENGTH&gt; &gt;IS NEEDED.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;3]8-10 QUESTIONS <BR>
WERE BASED ON LIQUID PRESSURE.4&gt; JARS&gt; ARE FULL OF WATER UP TO THE <BR>
SAME HEIGHT.THESE JARS&gt; ARE&gt; PROVIDED WITH TUBING&gt; &gt;OF DIFFERENT <BR>
LENGTH AND SHAPE AND ASKED IN WHICH&gt; FIGURE WE WILL HAVE HIGHEST <BR>
PRESSURE AT THE END OF&gt; THE&gt; TUBE.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;4]ONE QUESTION WAS : IN A <BR>
CENTRIFUGE WATER OIL AND&gt; MERQUERY IS POURED AND ROTATED.THEN WHICH <BR>
LIQUID&gt; WILL&gt; BE AT THE CENTER&gt; &gt;AND WHICH ONE WILL BE AT THE <BR>
PERIFERI.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;5]ONE QUESTION WAS :A MAN IS STANDING ON A STAND&gt; <BR>

DIFFERENT&gt; &gt;HEIGHT AND DRILLING A HOLE IN THE WALL.IN WHICH&gt; CASE&gt; HE <BR>
IS LIKELY TO FALL.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;6]THERE ARE 5 SHAPES FOR A DAM&gt; &gt; 1 &gt;&gt; &gt; 2 &lt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; 3 )&gt; &gt; 4 (&gt; &gt; 5 | &gt; &gt;WHICH WILL BE THE SAFEST.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;7]TWO OR THREE <BR>
QUESTIONS WERE ASKED ON BALANCING OF&gt; MASSES.LIKE ONE WEIGHT IS HUNG <BR>
ON ONE SIDE OF A &gt; LEVER&gt; THEN WHAT&gt; &gt;WILL BE THE WEIGHT OF BALANCING <BR>
ONE.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;SECTION 3&gt; &gt;--------------------------&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;THIS <BR>
SECTION IS OF FIGURATIVE APPTITUDE.&gt; &gt;IN A 3 BY 3 MATRIX ONLY THE <BR>
LAST BOX IS EMPTY.&gt; &gt;FIGURES OF EACH ROW HAS SOME RELATION AMONG <BR>
THEM.SO &gt; YOU HAVE TO FIND THE MISSING FIGURE&gt; &gt;FROM 7 OPTIONS.&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;THIS SECTIONS COTNTAINS 36 SUCH QUESTIONS . IT WON&gt; TAKE MORE THAN <BR>
15 MINUTES TO SOLVE UPTO 20.BUT THEN&gt; IT&gt; BECOMES SOMEWHAT&gt; <BR>

India (1)&lt;1%(2)&lt;10 (3)&lt;20 (4)&lt;50%22.on what parameters the current <BR>
carrying capacity of a conductor depends……..23.few questions on <BR>
circuit breakers(read nicely fault analysis in power systems)24.two <BR>
wires are there carrying current I in same dirction.distance between <BR>
wires is R. the force between them is proportional to ….ans:I`2/R25. <BR>
circuit breaker should operate in ……..tansient/subtansient/dc state………<BR>
26.among R,L,C which can be varied easily with great ease…………and <BR>
LISTEN IT MAY HAPPEN THAT U PEOPLE GET THE SAME SET AS OURS BECOZ AS <BR>
IT SEEMS HERE THEY HAVE ONLY LIMITED NUMBER OF COPIES OF QUESTION <BR>
PAPER WITH THEM.STUDY N GET FUNDA OF GEARS,PULLEY <BR>
MOVEMENT…..PRESSURE ,MOMENTS PROBLEM FOR &quot;MECHANICAL COMPREHENSION <BR>
PART&quot;. Questions concluded……. doing transformation or or it line <BR>
phase ratio.. 3.diff bet. AC seres mOT and DC serues mot.. 4.what's <BR>
the diff bet ceiling fan and table fan ans its in the direction of <BR>
rotation..CAP &amp;shadedpole funda ..like this.. 5. AMMETER VOLTMETER <BR>
DIFF OF RESISTANCES. 6.some KVA rating &amp; KV rating were given and u <BR>
have to find the rating of current from this with the help of <BR>
parameters.. <BR>
