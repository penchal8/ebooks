answers:
-----------
1)64
condition given :lusie age should fall between 54-70
suppose if she has 8 sons .
each son has 7 brother
each sons has 7 sons  (condition given :as many brothers they have)
8 sons having 56 sons
adding 56 + 8 =64
 
2) 90

3) actually i got 120 for the given data.
i forgot the figures, but i give u the step how to calculate
 
g - grass at the beginning  r - rate at which grass grows, per day  y - rate at which one cow eats grass, per day
n - no of cows to eat the grass in 90 days
formula: g+d*r=n*d*y ( i got this frm old infosys paper)

g + 30*r = 50 * 30 * y -->(1)
g + 60*r = 30 * 60 * y--->(2)
g + d*r = 60 * d * y --->(3)
frm (1)
g=1500y-30r
substitute g in (2)
1500y-30r+60r=1800y
30r=300y
r=10y
substitute y in (3)

1500y-300y+10dy=60dy
1200y=50dy
d=240 days
 
4)71842
5)
yellow (lie)
yellow (true)
blue   (true)
green  (lie)
 
6) 12 K.M
T1 + T2=6 (3 to 9.p.m)
T1-time during forward journey
T2-time during return journey
D1+D2-forwared/Return distance
D1/4+D1/3 =T1 (forward time)
D1/4+D2/6 =T2 (return time)
Adding we will get D1+D2=12 km

7)x=9 y=1,z=8
(i tried by assuming y=1 or y=2,(y-carry) i easily got)

8) 26 poles
solution:
if  n poles
(n-1) gaps of each 1000/(n-1) width
if n-1 poles
(n-2) gaps of each 1000/(n-2) width
so
1000/(n-2) -1000/(n-1)=5/3
1000(1/(n-2) -1/(n-1))=5/3
1000(1/(n-1)(n-2))=5/3
(n-1)(n-2)=(3/5)*1000=600
as  600=25*24
so number of  poles should be 26

9)andrew
