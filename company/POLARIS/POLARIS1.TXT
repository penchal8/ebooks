I got many mails regarding POLARIS test paper and interview pattern. First , i would like to mention that the test paper pattern is subject to change.

 

1. Aptitude test- 30 mins. 30 questions (both quant. and verbal)

2. Technical test- 30 mins. 40 questions (multichoice)

 

Time is not critical factor for well prepared person. I have completed the test 12 mins. before.

 

I had attended the test on 29th may at Mumbai. Test has total duration of 60 min. that contained 2 sections: 1) aptitude section 2)technical section. Both had time interval of 30 mins. Aptitude had 30 questions and technical had 40 questions.

 

Aptitude test was very easy to clear. Quant. contained  questions from R.S.Agarwal(Ratio, percentage, proportion, train, clock etc.) and verbal was also easy and contained synonym, antonym and sentence completion questions.

 

Technical section contained quest. of Data Structure, Operating System(Semaphores, IPC, dead locks etc…) , DBMS, C/C++, Computer Networks. Tech. is easy to clear if person possess fundamentals of above mentioned subjects.

 

Don’t worry abt tests since they are relatively easy to clear.

 

Before facing the interview, thoroughly scrutinize the POLARIS website. They will ask u abt POLARIS.

 

If anyone has query, feel free to ask.
