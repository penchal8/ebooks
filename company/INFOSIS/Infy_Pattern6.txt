Subject: [CHETANA] (INFO) for Infy Aspirants


Hi Friends,
Nice to c u r mails, Thanks for the wishes.

Since i recd n no. of mails n due to time factor i am not able to 
reply u up individually,but if time permits then i will definetely 
mail u up.

Most of them r asking criteria for the tests, for Infy test the 
criteria is not a big factor, he can either be a Engr student or even 
MCA, the post is the same.

Well to apply send u r resumes to freshers@infosys.com,ofcourse 
right now they r not recruiting any more coz they have to clear all 
the students who wrote in June and July.

But don't get disappointed they will recruit after 2-3 months so u 
all prepare in the mean time for Aptitude test and if possible 
upgrade u r s/w technologies.

You can get some old Puzzle papers at www.freshersworld.com and 
http:\\vvasan.hypermart.net
but I don't think there will be much use in preparing them. The 
reasons for that are :
1.    Normally, the questions will not be repeated in Infosys.
2.    Most of the answers given at these websites are wrong. Or there 
won't be any answers given. So, you will get confused unnecessarily, 
ofcourse they are  gr8 site where u can get lots n lots of 
information.It's the best site for the Job Hunters.

Suggested Books : 

"Puzzles to Puzzle you"  by Shakuntala Devi
"More Puzzles"  by Shakuntala Devi
Puzzle Book by George S. Summers

  GRE Barrons - Analytical questions (Take old edition of book. In 
new edition of GRE book, there are no analytical questions).But 
whatever you prepare, it mostly depends on your analytical abilities. 


Some one asked regarding employee referal scheme, but till i know i 
don't think in Infosys they will consider those things,ofcourse if 
it's TCS then only certain center allow it not all.

Never loose patience,always have an attitude of "NEVER SAY DIE".

If you get call letter for Exam means you are 50% selected and 
balance 50% is how u perform in Exam, so prepare best for Aptitude n 
u r into u r dream organization.

All the best friends,
Vanesh M Shah.
