hello friends........

im very thankful to chetana mam and all group members for getting into infosys. i have given my written test on 3 july & interview on 4 july Delhi. im joining at infy-Pune on 29 aug. im very proud to become an INFOSCION. i got my offer letter via mail after one month.
im from delhi and leaving on 26aug for pune.

once again i thank to all chetanites and now i belive to become an infoscion u must be a chetanite first.

my experience--
about written test u need to go through all the previous papers and solve atleast 150-200 puzzles from shakuntala devi-both parts.
i have done my preparation in 5-days only coz i have never solve any puzzle before i got the call letter. so when i can crack infy test with 9 ques right in just a prep. of 5 days, u people can also do.
no need to do goerge summer, it wo't help u.

about interview--
there were 2 middle age people in my panel.
> first they praised me for having very gud marks in puzzles(45 0ut of 50)
>after that they asked me very general HR questions
> the lady asked me what will i do if my husband asked me to leave my job after my marriage.
> she also asked me about the stones which im wearing
>the gentleman asked me about the team role & my poject
> both were very cool and this was my best interview coz i was smiling all the time and was not nervous not even a bit
> give ur answers with confidence and do't divert from ur point
>they called me again after i left interview room and asked me some probablity ques.

all the best to all of u......
