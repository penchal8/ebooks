Kanbay 8 jan 2005 hyderabad  : 
 

Hello

I have written the kanbay exam on 8 jan but dint get thru

Time 9.00AM

Total students appeared 300 per batch

And after that 8 were short listed for GD 

My advice to all guys appearing for kanbay in future is time management…speed and accuracy…most important…the question paper will be easy…u need t practice and practice..that’s the only way

Pattern this time

Same 30 questions aptitude and 30 questions reasoning..time 1 hr.15 min

And negative of ¼

This time the pattern was different… there was no problem from time and work …time and distance …profit and loss…simple interest ….compound interest…Trains…boats and streams ..pipes..my advice is to be prepared with all the topics from RS Agarwal . and also of icet pattern 

Topics covered were(including maths n logic)

Trigonometry(4)…quadratic equations(2)….progressions(1)…areas (3)…LCM(1)…..arithmatic reasoning was also given in maths section…it had 3 r 4 bits….stocks shares(4)…basic arithmatic…ages….averages…matrices..probability..permutations…deductions ..conclusions…number and alphabet series….clocks ..calenders..etc etc

The following is the paper…the order of the questions is not same…and also the figures r not exactly the same for some problems..but the model asked is same

 

1.      square root of 20.8849 Ans 4.57 

2.      roots of the equation are 4 and –11.which of the following is the equation … 

I don’t remember options

3.      If 3sin@+5cos@=5.then find the value of (3sin@-5Cos@)2 

4-6

there r 6 people A B C D E F..each of them have 10 marbles with them..then A and B take 4 marbles each from D and E.then C gives 3 marbles to F.then gives away the marbles to C back…and two more statements…3 questions on this..its very simple

questions r like 

4 how many marbles E had 

5 who had one more marble than F

6.

7 The average of scores of 40 innings of A is 50. The highest score is 178 more than the least score….If those two are removed then the average of the remaining 38 innings is 40 Then the value of the least score is …….numbers r not same but the model is 

8. the sum of the ages of sohan sunil and sanjay is 60 yrs .6 yrs before sohans age was two thirds of sunil and half of sanjay.find the age of sanjay

9.some amount of money has to be shared between A B C .the amount is 1500(not sure).A share is two ninghts of that of B and C .B share is three elevenths that of A and c togheter…find the shares of A B C Ans first option 280 330 _

10.there is a building of height 500m. The angles of depressionn of the top of the building with the top and bottom of the tower are 30 and 45..Find the height of the tower ans 200( don’t remember)

11.there are two persons standing in front of tower of height 300m..the angles of elevation are 30 and 60…find the distance between the two people…Ans 21.96

12 matrix was given 

x+2 x+3 x+4

x+3 x+5 x+11

x+7 x+12 x+14…find the determinant of the matrix

 

 

 

 

 

13-16

.One problem on arithmatic reasoning like

A B C 6

* F E

B C D G

A F H H

_ _ _ _ 8

the letters are not exactly the same but the numbers 6 and 8 are correct….

4 auestions based on this

 

17. What is the least number when subtraced frm 23 51 37 29 gives the result as 0

I dint understand this question..but better go thru LCM problems

18-21 some question was given on stocks and shares..it was very big.and then 4 questions based on this…..

22one more on trignometry consiting of some tan@ 

23.one more on complex numbers consisting of some alpha4beta4+alpha beta…..find the complex root

24 if X4+3X3+X2+1=0 then find the value of x3+2x2-1 question not exactly same but model is same 

25.two points were given (1,0,0) and (1,1,0). Find the perpendicular distance

26 find the length of the wire required to tie around a square 15 times whose area is 30 hectares 

27..find the amount of water that can be filled in a pipe of diameter 8 cm and length some value

In the above two problems the units were a bit complicated like in hectares, acres, cubic meters.. etc etc….so better be perfect with the conversions

28 there are 101 natural numbers…find the ratio of the sum of even numbers to the sum of odd numbers ans (51:50) check it

29.There are 500 students out of which 320 eat fish and 250 eat eggs..and 150 eat both..find the number of students who neither eat fish nor eat eggs

30. there are 6 boys and 4 girls .A committee of 5 is to be formed ..find the no of ways in which it can be formed in such a way that it includes atleast 2 girls

That’s all I remember in maths section
