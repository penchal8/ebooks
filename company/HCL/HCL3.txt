SECTION A 

The following program accepts a pair of 2 numbers from the user of system and totals them. Numbers are accepted in pair repeatedly and totaled, until grand total of all the pair of numbers accepted does not exceed 9.
Step 1             : Assign value 0 to x
Step 2             : Accept 1st number and assign to A
Step 3             : Accept 2nd number and assign to B                                     Freshersworld.com
Step 4            : Add A and B assign to C
Step 5             : Add C to X 
Step 6             : If X<10 go to Step 1
Step 7            : Stop.
The error in the above routine is
Step 6 should be If X<9 go to Step 1
Step 1 is redundant
Step 4 should be Add A & B and assign to X
Step 6 should read If x<10 go to Step 2
Step 1 should be Assign value 0 to A & B

The following program finds the greatest of the three numbers A, B and C and prints the result
Step 1             :             If A>B assign A to X
Step 2             :             If A>C assign A to X
Step 3             :             If B>C assign B to X                                             Freshersworld.com
Step 4            :             Print X
The error in the above program:
It does not work in case C > A
It does not work in case B > A
It does not work in case C > B
It does not work in case A = B = C
All of the above
Study the following program and answer the following questions :
Step 1             : A = 0
Step 2             : B = 0
Step 3             : If B > 1
Step 4            : A = A + 1
Step 5             : B = B  + 1
Step 6             : GOTO 7
Step 7             : END IF 9                                                                                  Freshersworld.com
Step 8             : B = B - 1
Step 9            : Stop.

         What is the value of B at termination of program?
 A) <1            B) 0            C) 1            D) 2            E) none of the these Object oriented language
