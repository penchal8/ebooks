1>( 3 marks)

Sandy's uncle died leaving 1000 rs behind to be distributed among his five nephews.

The money is to be divided among the nephews according to their ages. A person gets

Rs 20 more than his immediate younger brother.Sandy being the youngest what was his share?

Ans. Rs 160.0

It was quite an easy one.

let sandy's share be x

x+x+20+x+40+x+60+x+80=1000

5x+200=1000

x=800/5

x=160

Rohit was descending from the elavator which was not working. When he had stepped down

7 steps his sir started from the bottom of the elevator and they passed each other and when Rohit had still 4 steps to go down, his sir reached at the top. Taking into consideration that sir’s 2 steps took same time as Rohit’s one what were the total no of steps?

Ans

22 steps

let no of steps be x

speed=distance/time

Distance covered by Rohit = x-7-4 (7 steps already covered and 4 were still to go)

Distance covered by sir = x

Speed of Rohit =s

Speed of sir = 2s

Time taken is equal in both the cases so

Time(rohit)=time(sir)

(x-7-4) / s = x / 2s

2x – 22 = x

x=22

 

 

3> ( 3 marks)

A vendor who is an ex-mathematician has a number of apples and when he arranges them in rows of 3 he is left with one more, when he arranges them in rows of 5 again he is left with 1 more, Same happens with when he tries to arrange them in rows of 7 and 9 that is 1 apple is left extra.

But when he arranges them in a row of 11 he is left with none. Can u tell me how many apples were there?

Ans

946

the no is a multiple of 3,5,7,9 + a remainder of 1. So

3* 5* 7* 9= 945 + 1 =946

946 /11= 86

so it is divisible by 11 also.

A theft was reported in a p[olice station and police detained 3 persons – Tommy, Lee and Andy on the basis of doubt. However everyone said that he did not steal and one among the other two is the thief. Later on police came to know that Tommy was lying. Who was the real thief?

Ans

Tommy

He gave 2 false statements:

1: he didn’t steal though he was the thief.

2: one among the other two did it. If he is the thief how can other 2 do it.

It was very easy and infact that created a doubt n everyone cross checked it again n again to be sure as nobody was expecting such a simple puzzle.

The temperature is noted for 5 consecutive days and it is noted that no two days have the same temperature. Moreover the product of all the 5 readings is 12. The difference is noted to the nearest degrees. What were the readings of the temperature?

Ans: -2, -1, 1, 2, 3

Factors of 12: 4*3,6*2

2*2*3 bt 2 cant b repeated so –2 and to nullify -ve sign –1 is there

so –2 *-1 * 1 * 2 *3 = 12

A dice has faces 1 against 6, 3 against 5 and 2 against 4 always. How many such combinations of faces are possible in a dice?

Ans

24

keeping 1 and 6 fixed, we can have two combinations of 6 and 3, and two of 2 and 4 that means four. And interchanging 1 and 6 we can have two more combinations that means with one pair 8 combinations are there : 4*2=8. Similarly with other two also 8 combos. So in all 8*3=24 combos are possible.

8> (4 marks)

A boy’s age is 5 times as old as his sister. His father’s age is twice to that of his mother who is five times as old as the boy. The sum of all of them equals to that of his grandmother who is celeberating his 81st birthday. How old is the boy?

Ans:

5 years old

let boys age b x

sister’s = x/5

mother’s=5x

fatther’s=2(5x)

grandmother’s=81

81=x/5+x+5x+10x

81*5 = x+5x+ 25x +50x

405 = 81x

x= 405/81

x=5

so boys age is 5 years
