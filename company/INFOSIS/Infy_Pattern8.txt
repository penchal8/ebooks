hi freinds,
i'm happy to inform you all that i got through infosys....my training has started in b'lore. my pay is 15k. I fristly wanna thank chetana madam for all the support she is providing to the freshers and for all the help through the papers and tips.

To tell about the infy test.....its enough if you go through tha follwing material...
Shankuntala Devi- puzles to puzzle you & more puzzles.
George Summers book
The website- www.brainvista.com
and if time permits tha book of Ravi narula...oneÂ  more suggestion....its nothing like if you are thorough with these books you can crack the test...these books guide us in the approach to solve the problems and if lucky enough some problems might repeat....first start with the Shakun....books...make sure you know everything in these books then move on to Geroge summers.....dont worry about Barrons...one can do without that.....
after the puzzle test is the english paper fro half an hr....pretty easy paper...dont worry.......thats it from me....any doubts you can always mail me.....wish you all the best....and thankyou chetana madam....see you
