Hi friends!

 

Howz life going?

 

I just wanna share my experience regarding my HR round in Infosys.

 

I had my written test on 7th Aug and Hr round on 8th Aug.

 

HR à Two ladies: She1 (approx 25yrs, she was babe),

                               She2 (approx 40yrs, who cares...... )

Prashanth  à Me

 

I had my HR round in d afternoon around 12:15pm. It Started like tis…..

 

 

Me: Excuse Me Mam

She1: ya plz come in

Me: Good Afternoon Mam

She2: Very Good Afternoon, Plz take ur seat.

Me: Thank u.

 

She1:Wat's ur native

Me: Rajasthan.

 

She1: How long ur in Chennai

Me: Past 18 yrs.

 

She1: Wat made u 2 come Chennai

Me: Dad's Business.

 

She1: Tell me about urself 

Me: bla bla bla…..

 

She1: Y did u choose B. Tech 

Me: my interest in programming made me to choose B.Tech

 
She1:  wat is diff bet B.Tech and B.E
Me :  B.Tech deals wit 80% s/w and 20% h/w, where as B.E deals wit 50% s/w and 50% h/w.
        We focus more on programming side then B.E.
        B.Tech are more advanced the B.E, that's y we are called as Bachelor of Technology 
        while they are called as Bachelor of Engineering.

 
She1: gud ! ( After a long time )
I was happy tat they were not asking me any puzzles, It was moving smoothly,
but suddenly…………….

 
She1: ok Prashanth read this question and answer me in 30 sec
(She gave me a paper and asked me to read 3rd question)

The question was  " What is in between Taxicab ? "             ( Hey can u guess)

Me: I was thinking tat it may be space or person then suddenly clicked I said " i "

 
She2: Wat is the other usage of Thermometer except measuring temperature?
Me : since Mercury is a poisonous liquid. It could b used 2 kill a person or tree 
        i.e. it can b used to kill any living organism.

 
She2: then I'll never give u a thermometer, fine Prashanth, read this question and answer?

The question was " Pick the odd Man out?  [a] Bitch [b] puppy [c] Tabby [d] Mongrel
Me: Answered 1st Puppy then Bitch 
       ( was wrong, answer was tabby since its d only cat in d group )

 
She2: Outside a room U see a board stating Mind ur head, when u enter in the room u c a
          bulb hanging, tell me wat is the height of the room?
Me: I'll drop the bulb form the room and find the time at which it strikes the floor, 
        keeping time and speed I can calculate the distance i.e. height using physics
        Formula: distance = speed * time taken. (Somehow managed)

 
She1: have u ever came under dilemma?
Me : yes, when I finished my higher secondary, I was in dilemma 2 choose either my

       dad's business or Engineering… then bla bla bla….

 
She1: have u ever came under pressure?
Me :  yes, when I was doing my final year project. My teammate met wit an accident and the
        whole project …. then  bla bla bla….. ( Actually tat was a fake answer)
 
 
She1 : y it took so long for u 2 search a job ? Is this ur 1st hr interview?
Me : (I was thinking wat 2 answer then…) 
       No Mam, this is my 4th hr interview, Then a big story about
       Igate (got selected but they did not take me since MNM had a bad impression), then
       Proton (cleared tech round waiting for hr call ), 
       TCS ( Got cheated in Tech round)…
       Made them to believe tat iam an genuine guy..

 

 
She1: r u not feeling bad, by getting rejected by all those companies?
Me: Till yesterday I was feeling bad, but today its quite different, iam happy.  
        I think it was their bad time and my good time since I got d chance to sit in front of a big
        Personalities like u…. (Impressive Answer )
 
(Both gave a smile, which increased my confidence level to d peak)

She2: well Prashanth, Do u have any questions to ask?
Me : Current tech ur focusing on?

She2: Bla bla bla ….

Me: About ur latest projects?
She1: we have many projects from mini to major, which are highly confidential, so v cannot  
          tell u…

Me: about ur Mysore Training Center, heard like its India's biggest training center. Is it over 
       or under construction?
She1 : d construction is almost over. Anything else u wanna know Prashanth?
Me :  Nothing mam,

She1: r u not interested in knowing about Infosys
Me : Yes Mam, but I have gathered enough information about tat.

She1: Then plz tell me wat u know about Infosys?

        then their major alliances, their branches, their growth and many more….. I ended my 
        answer by saying tat "Mam even I have d photo of the 7 s/w professionals who founded
