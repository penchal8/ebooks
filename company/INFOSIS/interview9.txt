Hello Madam,

PLEASE APPROVE THIS MAIL!!!

This mail is regarding the Infosys interview
procedure.

I cleared the written test on June 19th and I was
called for interview on june 20th.(Both are in
hyderabad)

My interview went on for 20mins.There were two
interviewers. One middle aged and one in young person.

They asked to me tell about myself.
They asked about my percentage variations. I got less
percentage in my first year of engineering. So, they
asked me why there is variation like this.
They gave me a puzzle. Make 4 equilateral triangles
with 6 match sticks. I answered the puzzle.
They asked my strengths and weakness.
They asked in detail about my B.Tech final year
project. They asked me to tell instances where I
exhibited team work. For any point I tell, they asked
me to support with examples. Like if I say my strength
is hard working nature. Then they asked me tell an
instance where you exhibited it.
So overall it was pretty cool. They did not ask me any
technical questions. It was more of like a HR
interview.

Points to remember
-----------------

1) Be prepared with "Tell me about yourself"
2) Be prepared with your strengths and weakness. Make
neutral statements. For eg. if you say my weakness is
I am lazy, then it will give negeative impact.
3) They will surely ask one or two puzzles in the
interview also. They are interested to see your
analysis. So, neatly explain them.
4) When they ask your favourite subject, tell a
subject which u are strong and which is not very
tough.
5) Be flexible to posting location. If you are rigid
they will not select you.
6) Show them that you are very good team worker and
flexible to take up any kind of  job.

That's all from me

All the best to everyone
bye bye
