Questions from allegation and mixture,boats and streams,geometry
(square,rectangle.simple ones),clock,lines and
angles(q's like.find the missing angle.easy ones) were asked.

That's it friends.This is all i remember.Overall the paper was 
easy.time is an important factor.
math section takes more time than logical so adjust your timing 
accordingly.both the papers will be given
at the same time it's our choice to start with anysection.There seems 
to be atlest three different sets of qpapers.
Quantitative aptitude by R.S.Aggarwal for aptitide,Barrons GRE or MBA 
preparation material by R.S.Aggarwal for 
Geometry are good to follow.

   I did not clear the test,coz i did not get enough time to attempt 
many q's in the math section.
My friend balaji cleard the test,he did 21 and 23 q's in each 
section.Out of 4000 people appeared for the written test 
600 were taken for the GD out of which around 60 were taken for the 
interview.

Here is the info for GD from Mr.Balaji:
Group Discussion:
------------------
There were 10 members in each group.
1,2 or 3 were selected from each group.sometimes not even one was 
selected.
My GD topic was "should beauty contest be banned in India".
Initially i spoke in favour of the beauty contest some colleges 
against it.After some time 
we were asked,like those who spoke in favour of beauty contest were 
asked to speak against it and vice versa.
only one was selected in our group.i did well but i don't know why i 
got missed out.
They look for good communication skill,how we work in a group and 
also how good points we putforth.

Wishes for those who are going to take the Kanbay test.
With regards,
P.Manjunath,S.Balaji,R.Manivannaprabu
