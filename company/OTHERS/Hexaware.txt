Wat I felt with this test was it was better to go thro all the 100 ques, cos some easy ones were there at the last. If U think U can certainly solve a problem but its time consuming just leave it and proceed to the next one. Some of the ques were very easy, even U no need to use pen and paper. 

ALL THE BEST TO THOSE APPEARING FOR THE WRITTEN TEST.
With Wishes

Tips
1. Do the coding first and you are out - They are time consuming - Save the worst for last 

2. Be choosy - take the easy (questions) first - So scan scan scan

odd man out ----> 
computer awareness ----> 
easy sums ----->
difficult sums---->
coding

do this or find the path to your home. 


4.SPEED kills but also wins. Put your brain in 5th gear 

5.Blind goose guess - mark a or e - they are more probable 

6. Write your q paper code proper or your are a man overboard

8. They will ask u in the pep talk in GD waht is the first or last question or your code. 
So watch out all those DANGER-PAST-QUESTIONS-FORGOT type fellows
