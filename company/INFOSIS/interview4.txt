Hi Friends,
 
After a long struggle I got job in Infosys. My joining date is 25th july in Mysore.
 
I wrote the written test on 19th june in Chennai. The test was very easy, I solved 9 puzzles. English section was easy, only two three ques were tough. I was called for the interview on the very next day.
In the interview I was asked some general questions like, Introduce yourself, Speak about leadership, How good a leader you are? Speak about corruption, etc, They gave me three logical reasoning questions, I solved them. The interviewer then asked me to give a description of my final project. also, he asked me the details about the paper presentations I had done. He asked if I am ready to work anywhere in India. Then he gave me a chance to ask questions. Thats all. I got the offer letter on 2nd july.
 
Chennai guys joining Infy, mysore on the same date please mail me. Also I welcome any info about Infy training.
 
Keep trying... Success will be yours,
 
with regards,
Vimal
